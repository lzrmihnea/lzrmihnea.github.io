[Bo Burlingham][small-giants-website] offers an attractive handful of examples of small successful companies, along with their stories, culture and way of working.

Compared to large companies, the small companies described appear in a romantic light.

This happens due to the leaders' motivation towards more than financial gain, and rather towards:
- the personal growth and wellbeing of employees
- a quality product
- flexibility, comfort and peace of mind with running a tight, manageable business

It is important to be noted that the second edition of the book offer a small amount of extra information by revisiting the small companies described in the first edition and showing how difficult it was to maintain the small company culture due to: growth, bankruptcy, culture change, management change.
