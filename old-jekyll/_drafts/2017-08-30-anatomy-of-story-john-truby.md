Anatomy of story
# Writing exercise 1 - Creating your premise
1. Premise - write it down in 1 sentence. Ask yourself if it could change your life.
2. Wish list and premise list. Write these down and identify what you care about and enjoy.
3. Possibilities for the premise, write these down.
4. Story challenges and problems. Try to find as many for your idea as possible.
5. Design principle - deeper process or form in which the story will play out in a unique way.
6. Best character - the hero of the story.
7. Conflict - "Who is my hero fighting, what is he fighting about?"
8. Basic action - single cause-and-effect pathway, identifying a basic action the hero will take in the story.
9. Character change - basic action (A) -> go in the opposite way, exploring weaknesses (W) -> his/her change (C) at the end.
10. Moral choice - made at the end of the story. Difficult, but plausible.
11. Audience appeal - is the premise likely to appeal to the audience.

# Seven key steps of Story Structure
1. Weakness and need
- psychological and/or moral, inner
- *a psychological need affects the hero*
- *a moral need affects others*
2. Desire - outer, reported to the outer world
3. Opponent
- competing with the hero for the same goal
- has a special ability to attack the hero's greatest weaknesses
4. Plan
- guidelines, strategies that the hero will use to overcome the opponent and reach the goal or desire.
- shapes the rest of the story, involves many steps
- the hero has to adjust when it fails
- look for the deepest conflict that they can fight over
5. Battle
- in the Godfather, it is a crosscut between Michael's appearance at his nephew's baptism and the killing of the heads of the 5 Mafia families.
6. Self-revelation - comes after the battle.
7. New equilibrium - desire is gone, hero has evolved thanks to the self-revelation.

# Writing exercise 2 - using the 7 steps
1. Story events - describe each story event in a single sentence.
2. Order the event roughly
3. Identify the 7 structure steps

## When creating the hero as well as other characters, connect and compare them to each other!
## All characters connect and define each other in four major ways: by story function, archetype, theme and opposition.

# TODO what are each?

## Each opponent can represent a negative aspect of society/hero.

## For multihero stories, each main character must be put through all seven steps.
- With multiple characters, the hero in one storyline can become the opponent in another.
- Characters can be connected by being examples/different facades of a single subject or theme.
- Use a cliffhanger at the end of one line to trigger a jump to another line.
- Each human being is unique in an unlimited number of ways, but at the same time human with features we all share. These are shown in action, in space, across time, and compared to others.


## The moment of revelation:
- sudden, for maximum dramatic force for the hero and audience.
- should create a burst of emotion for the hero and audience, as they share the hero's realization.
- should be new information for the hero; he/she should see for the first time that they have been living a lie about themselves which has caused pain both for the hero and those around.
- should trigger the hero to take new moral action, immediately, proving the change caused by the revelation.
## The setup of the revelation:
- hero must be a thinking person, capable of seeing the truth and knowing right action.
- hero must be hiding something from themselves.
- the lie must be hurting the hero in a very real way.

## The opponent:
- love this character
- the opponent holds a key, because the hero learns through his opponent. It is only because the opponent is attacking the hero's greatest weakness, that the hero is forced to deal with it and grow.
- find a natural reason for the hero and opponent to stay in the same place during the course of the story.

# Writing exercise 3 - creating your character
Create the character web, listing them as detailed as possible and attributing their functions(hero, main opponent, ally, fake-ally, subplot character).
- central moral problem of the story?
- compare the characters, by the following structural elements:
-- weaknesses
-- need, both psychological and moral
-- desire
-- values
-- power, status, ability
-- how each face the central moral problem
- each character should have a different approach towards the central moral problem
- requirements of a hero:
-- constantly fascinating
-- the audience should identify with the character to a certain extent
-- the audience should empathize (not sympathize) with the hero
-- hero should have a moral and psychological need
- hero's character change: begin with the self-revelation, then go back and determine the starting point of the change, which is the hero's need and/or desire. Then figure out the steps of development in between.
- changed beliefs: write down the beliefs your hero challenges and changes.
- hero's desire: clarify a single goal that extends throughout the story.
- opponents detailed, along with a few values for each opponent.
- minor character should be variations on the hero's weakness and moral problem.
- four-corner opposition. In a 2x2 matrix, list in each cell the main character, main opponent and two secondary opponents. Push the values and traits of each as far away from the other as possible.
- the audience should understand the character but not necessarily like everything he does. The reason behind the character's actions should be shown.
- the hero is initially wrong about his true reason for going after the goal and does not discover his real motive until the end of the story
- the same value should be represented in the positive and negative version.
- the hero will have a moral flaw at the beginning and then his desperation to beat the opponent will bring out the worst in him. He has to get worse before he gets better.

## Moral argument: basic strategy
- beliefs and values with which the hero starts.
- moral weakness which causes the hero to hurt those around, unknowingly.
- moral need, based on the moral weakness, which causes the hero to want to be better and act properly towards those around.
- first immoral action, serves as evidence of the weakness.
- desire, the hero comes up with a goal toward which all else is sacrificed, which leads him into conflict with an opponent, with the same goal but different values.
- drive, the hero and opponent advance towards the goal.
- immoral actions. While starting to conflict with the opponent, the hero takes a series of immoral actions out of desperation to win. Other characters should criticize the hero for this.
- attack by ally.
- obsessive drive, galvanized by new revelations. The immoral actions can continue.
- battle, or final conflict.
- moral self-revelation.
- moral decision, between 2 possible actions, which brings him towards the self-revelation.
- thematic revelation, where the theme achieves its greatest impact. It is not limited to the hero, but rather an insight from the audience about how people in general should act and live in the world.

## Writing exercise 4 - Outlining the moral argument
1. Design principle - turn this into a theme line (your view about right and wrong action in 1 sentence). Focus on its key actions and moral effects.
2. Theme line techniques - like symbols, that can encapsulate the principle into a structure unique to the story.
3. Moral choice, that the hero must make in the end of the story.
4. Moral problem, that the hero confronts throughout the story.
5. Characters as variations on a theme, starting with the hero and main opponent, each should approach the central moral problem differently.
6. Values in conflict

## Writing exercise 5 - Creating the story world
1. One-line description of the world, using the design principle
2. Overall arena. How will a single arena be maintained throughout the story?
3. Value oppositions and visual oppositions - assign visual oppositions that complement the characters' value oppositions.
4. Land, people and technology - explain how this combination is molded in your story.
5. System - the hero works and lives in a system with rules and hierarchies which should be explained, along with the hero's place.
6. Natural settings, could be included in the story, such as an ocean, a forest, but should be added in a way tailored for the story, unique, unpredictable.
7. Weather. While avoiding cliches, some weather conditions can be used for certain moments of the story, to outline underlying messages.
8. Man-made spaces, can also help express certain ideas or symbols.
9. Passageways, if the character moves from one world to another, the passageway should be unique.
10. Hero's change or world change - decide if the world will also change, along with the hero.
11. Seasons. If relevant and original, the passing of the seasons can be connected to the story.
12. Subworlds. Any character or moment of the story can have a subworld attached.

## Writing exercise 6 - Creating symbols
1. Story symbol - is there at least one symbol to express the premise, key story twists, central theme or overall structure of the story?
2. Symbolic characters, to determine the symbols for these:
2.1. Look at the entire character web before creating a symbol for a single character.
2.2. Begin with the opposition between hero and main opponent.
2.3. Come up with a single aspect of the character or a single emotion you want the character to evoke in the audience.
2.4. Consider applying a symbol opposition within the character.
2.5. Repeat the symbol, in association with the character, many times over the course of the story.
2.6. Each time you repeat the symbol, vary the detail in some way.
3. Character type - consider connection some characters to types, like gods, animals or machines.
4. Symbolic character change - can a symbol be attributed to a character change? Look at the beginning scenes where the needs and weaknesses of a character are expressed, and at the end where the revelation is expressed.
5. Symbolic theme, encapsulates the main theme of the story.
5.1. Thematic symbol, is one that stands for two series of moral actions in conflict.
6. Symbolic world. Symbols can be attached to the natural settings, man-made spaces, technology and time.
7. Symbolic actions can be attributed to the actions of some characters.
8. Symbolic objects
9. Symbol development - chart how each symbol changes over the course of the story.

## Symbols
The most intense concentration of meaning of all the symbol techniques
an image or object that expresses a series of actions that hurt others in some way.
Even more powerful is an image or object that expresses two series of actions, two moral sequences, that are in conflict with each other.


## The 22 building steps of storytelling:
1. Self-revelation, need, and desire
1.1. What will my hero learn at the end?
1.2. What does he know at the beginning? No character is a blank slate.
1.3. What is the hero wrong about at the beginning? This is what he should learn until the end, what the self-revelation will be about.
2. Ghost and story world
2.1. The ghost represents the past of the hero. Something that haunts the hero.
2.2. The story world is the setting and universe of the story. This must be unique and detailed.
3. Weakness and need
Openings. The steps so far represent the opening of the story. These openings can be:
3.1. Running start. Classic, designed to catch the reader in first few pages, made up of a few structural elements, such as the hero having a strong ghost.
3.2. Slow start. Seldom used, involves stories with a purposeless hero at the beginning, until the hero learns his desire.
4. Inciting event
5. Desire. While building the story, the intensity of the desire can grow, to emphasize its importance.
6. Ally or allies
7. Opponent and/or mystery. The best opponent is the necessary one; the character best able to attack the greatest weakness of the hero.
8. Fake-ally opponent
9. First revelation and decision: Changed desire and motive
10. Plan
- In good stories, the hero's initial plan almost always fails.
11. Opponent's plan and main counterattack
12. Drive
13. Attack by ally
14. Apparent defeat
15. Second revelation and decision: Obsessive drive, changed desire and motive
16. Audience revelation
17. Third revelation and decision
18. Gate, gauntlet, visit to death
19. Battle
20. Self-revelation
21. Moral decision
22. New equilibrium

- Drama usually has the 22 steps.
- In a multi-strand drama, each strand hits the 7 steps.

## Writing exercise 7 - Creating your plot
1. Review the design principle and theme of the story.
- If a story symbol is used, the plot should be an expression of this symbol.
2. Storyteller. Decide if one will be used, and keep in mind there are structural techniques for one.
3. Describe the 22 steps in detail.
4. Reveals sequence. List these separate from the other steps, and look for the following elements to make them as dramatic as possible:
- The sequence should be logical.
- Each reveal more intense than the previous.
- Each reveal causes the hero's original desire to change in some way.
- As the story moves towards the end, the reveals come at a faster pace.

## Writing exercise 8 - Scene weave
1. List every scene in the story in a single sentence.
2. Tag any scenes that include on of the 22 steps.
- If the story has more than one plotine or subsection, label each with the appropriate plotine.
2.2. Ordering scenes, should be done by structure, not chronological:
- See if scenes can be cut.
- Look for opportunities to combinare 2 scenes into 1.
- Add a scene wherever there are gaps in the story's development.

## Scene construction and ministory
A scene is a ministory. A good scene should have 6 of the 7 structure steps (self-revelation is excluded), which is reserved for the hero at the end of the story.
To construct a scene, 2 objectives are to be achieved:
1. Determine how it fits and furthers the overall hero development.
2. Make it a good ministory.
The beginning of the scene should frame what the scene is about, and should funnel down to a single point, with the most important word or line of dialogue stated last.

To construct a sequence, the following ideas can help:
1. Position on the character arc.
- How does this scene fit into the character development?
- How does it further the development?
2. Problems - What must be accompplished or solved in this scene?
3. Strategy - What strategy can be used to solve the problem?
4. Desire
- Which character desire will drive this scene?
- What is the character's motivation?
5. Endpoint - What does the character's desire resolve?
6. Opponent - Who opposes the desire and what do the two or more characters fight about?
7. Plan - The character with the desire comes up with a plan.
8. Conflict - Builds to a breaking point or a solution.
9. Twist or reveal.

## Dialogue.
Dialogue is not real talk, it is highly selective language that sounds like it could be real. Good dialogue is always more intelligent, wittier, more metaphorical and better argumented than in real life.
Great dialogue is not a melody, but a symphony, happening on 3 tracks simultaneously:
1. Story dialogue - Talk about what the characters are doing, about the story.
2. Moral dialogue
- On right and wrong action.
- Provides depth, texture and scope.
- About the character's attitudes and points of view.
3. Key words or phrases - Words with the potential to carry meaning, symbolically and thematically.

Common place uses for dialogue:
- Expressing moral argument when an ally criticizes the hero for taking an immoral action while trying to win the goal, to which the hero, who hasn't yet had a self-revelation, takes a defensive attitude.
- In a conflict between the hero and the opponent. Can happen anywhere over the course of the story but most likely during a battle scene.
- When the main opponent gives a moral justification for his actions, even though he is wrong.

To write a good monologue, a complete story must be told, which means hitting the 7 structure steps and ending with the key word or key line.


## The arena
- Basic space of drama.
- A single, unified place surrounded by some kind of wall.
- Everything inside the arena is part of the story.


## Closing scene
- To write a great closing scene, you must realize that it is the point of the full story and that the scene itself is a mini-story, with the key word or line of the scene and the entire story coming last.
- You are the never-ending story. If you want to tell the great story, you must, like your hero, face your own seven steps.
